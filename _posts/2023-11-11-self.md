Who am I? The fundamental question of self is an inevitable topic of thought for every human. In those stages of life when we are more naive, content, or motivated, we tend to think lightly of it. The true import of the question only becomes known when one falls into the more negative part of the realm of emotions. Most, if not all, of the major depressions in our life can be reducible to a thwarted attempt at defining self.
