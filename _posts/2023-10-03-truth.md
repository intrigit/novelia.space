Humans have lives just long enough to know that what we usually refer to as truth is ephemeral. Yet truth is something we cling on to, something we cherish so much as not to get lost in our journey forward.

## The Relativity of Truth

Experience has led me to conclude that truth is most of the time relative, but not completely, so as not to fall into the pitfall of absolute relativism.

Absolute relativism is inherently contradictory: if "nothing can be absolute", then the truth value of the assertion can not be absolute either. On the other hand, if it is not the case that "nothing can be absolute", we still face the question about whether the statement is false (i.e., absolute truth exists) or an *indeterminate* third value (i.e., absolute truth may exist or not).

For the purpose of my writing, it is not productive to ask whether absolute objective truth exists. For now, I will put the question aside and focus on a more "pointed" version of relativity. While much flexibility exists for the "truthfulness" of any statement, there are trends and inclinations in it.

## Truth and Value Judgement

What is good, and what is bad? What is right, and what is wrong?
