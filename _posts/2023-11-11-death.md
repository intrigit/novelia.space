Much as we fear death, we have to learn to embrace it. Not because we have to accept the fact that All Men Must Die. Nor because of the need to prepare ourselves for it. But because it is from death, and death only, that anything significant receives its value.

## Death is everything. Eternality is nothingness.

All of us dream of having eternal lives. But if one day, humans are really granted eternal life, they will not want to live eternally. If one is forced to live eternally, it will be a curse rather than blessing.
