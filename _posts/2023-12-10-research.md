Here I take notes of passing thoughts on scientific research.

## Knowledge, Scientific Intuition and Scientific Skills

Knowledge sets the foundation for every scholarly pursuit, scientific skills make you a qualified scholar, while scientific intuition decides how far you can go.

## What should be a good motive for research?

GETTING PAPERS ACCEPTED vs. GETTING CITATIONS vs. GENERATING RESEARCH IMPACT, what is the ultimate goal?

From a discussion with more senior researchers I am getting a feeling that none of the abovementioned goals are ultimate. Instead, for them the ultimate goal is very simple: to make themselves happy.

## Theories Serve to Predict

It seems to me that people generally favor theories that predicts better. Indeed, how can a theory survive and be remembered if it cannot predict anything?

The ability to predict is oftentimes more credited compared to the completeness of theory itself.

## A Scholarly Investment in Effort

Let's consider a simplified scenario. Suppose that the sum of our available time for work throughout our life is a fixed number. You are free to allocate the time slots to whatever you see fit. What would be your schedule if you want to produce world-class scientific research?

For me, I would definitely like to reserve some quality time for the cultivation of scientific intuitions. Acquirement of knowledge is certainly important, but a mindless bump into the vast universe of knowledge only gets us lost in it. We simply do not have the time to learn everything. We need guidances. Quality guidances. And that is where good scientific intuitions shine.
