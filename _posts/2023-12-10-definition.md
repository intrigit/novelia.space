Definitions are natural derivatives of the categorization efforts of human, a necessary component of reason.

Perhaps we should begin the discussion by making a number of definitions.

How to define literature?
How to define music?

Those definitions are notoriously hard to give, and has only been obscurely outlined by scholars as not completely objective or subjective.

Borrowing from [my truth theory](truth.md) objects of consistency also exist for definitions. Every definition must be understood and evaluated with pertinence to its scope.

I do not, for instance, think that the infamous 4'33 is invariably music to everyone. The significance of 4'33 should rather been put against a cultural background, an apex of carefully organized, tonal music. It is undeniable that 4'33 has made such a big impact on musicians with regard to the extends of music, but that reason along does not justify its empty, non-music nature.
